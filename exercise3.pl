%%%%  What is the prior probability that player 1 wins?

% Q1
% query(winner(player1)).
% winner(player1):        0.1562878
% winner(player2):        0.1834804
% Well player1 has 4 cards and there are 4^4 permutation of hands and every hand can hold many probabilities for the most likely best hands.
% The same hold for player2 so one can se how the number computation explodes with O(n^4) and since every branch need to be 
% evaluated to compute the probability.

% RANT: Playing with 2 card in hand is more feasible and the results presented are from that 
% commutation. One thing that frustrates me is that the probabilities for player1 and player2 does not add up to 1 but i cant 
% solve since i have spent way to match time on this lab hence i as for help from you!
% This was a fun lab to do but i did not expect spending 60h to explore the intreating landscape of Prolog and Problog.  
% If this lab will be offered for other student a in the future a better cheat sheet is needed since documentation is lacking 
% and all Prolog features are not supported. But nice to knows are how to decompose statements how to identify issues with stochastic 
% memoization and how to use trial identifier. Is there a debugger and or a profiler?  
% My final thoughts im very open for feedback since i can se myself using Problog in the future but im not 
% really sure about best practices. Since its first time for me using Prolog and Problog I assume the there are many weird stuff
% in the code and i would love to get feedback how to improve.
% thanks.
