%%%% Whatâ€™s the probability that player2 draws the hand [ace, king, queen, ace].
%%%% Your answer : 



%%%%  Given that player2 draws the hand [ace, king, queen, ace], and that the coin comes up tails, what is the posterior belief that your opponent is cheating?
%%%% Your answer : 



%%%%  What is the prior probability that player 1 wins?1 Why does this query take so long to answer? What is the probability that player 1 wins, given that you know that player 2 is a cheater?
